    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup milk powder</li>
        <li> 1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li> 1/4 teaspoon baking soda </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons ghee (clarified butter)
        </li>
        <li> 2-3 tablespoons milk (approx.)</li>
        <li>A pinch of cardamom powder </li>
        <li> Chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios) for garnish (optional)</li>
        
        <p class="Hello"> For Sugar Syrup </p> 
        <li> 1.5 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1.5 cups water </li>
        <li> A few saffron strands </li>
        <li> 1/2 teaspoon rose water (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Hello"> Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sugar syrup: In a saucepan, add sugar and water. Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 5 minutes until the sugar dissolves completely. Add saffron strands and rose water (if using) to the syrup. Continue simmering the syrup on low heat for another 5 minutes until it reaches a slightly sticky consistency. Keep the sugar syrup warm while you prepare the Gulab Jamun. </li> 
        <li> Make the Gulab Jamun dough: In a mixing bowl, combine milk powder, all-purpose flour, baking soda, and a pinch of cardamom powder. Mix well. Add ghee to the dry ingredients and mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Gradually add milk and knead gently to form a soft and smooth dough. The dough should be slightly moist but not sticky.</li>
        <li> Shape the Gulab Jamun: Divide the dough into small equal-sized portions and roll them into smooth balls. Make sure there are no cracks on the surface of the balls. </li>
        <li>Fry the Gulab Jamun: Heat oil or ghee in a deep pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, reduce the heat to low. Carefully drop the prepared Gulab Jamun into the hot oil, a few at a time. Fry them on low heat, stirring gently, until they turn golden brown and evenly cooked. Fry them in batches, as overcrowding the pan can lower the temperature of the oil and affect the texture of Gulab Jamun. </li>
        <li> Soak in sugar syrup: Once the Gulab Jamun are fried, remove them from the oil and drain on a paper towel to remove excess oil. Immediately transfer the hot Gulab Jamun into the warm sugar syrup. Allow them to soak in the syrup for at least 1 to 2 hours. During this time, the Gulab Jamun will absorb the syrup and become soft and moist. </li>
        <li> Garnish and serve: Garnish the soaked Gulab Jamun with chopped nuts (if desired). Serve them warm or at room temperature. They are best enjoyed when served fresh. </li>

    </ol>
