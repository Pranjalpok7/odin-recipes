   <h2> Description </h2>
   <p>Chai tea, also known as masala chai, is a delicious and aromatic spiced tea that originated in India.
     It's made with a blend of black tea, aromatic spices, milk, and sweetener. 
     Here's a simple recipe to make a classic cup of chai tea</p>
    <h3> Ingredients </h3> 
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups water </li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk (you can use any milk of your choice) </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons black tea leaves or 4 black tea bags </li>
        <li> 4-5 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li> 4-5 whole cloves </li>
        <li> 1-inch piece of fresh ginger, sliced (optional)</li>
        <li> 1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li> 1-2 tablespoons of sweetener (sugar, honey, or any other sweetener of your choice)</li>
        <li> A pinch of ground black pepper (optional) </li>
        <li> A pinch of ground nutmeg (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li> In a saucepan, add water and all the spices (cardamom pods, cloves, ginger, and cinnamon stick). Bring it to a boil and let it simmer for about 5 minutes. This will infuse the water with the flavors of the spices. </li>
        <li> Add the black tea leaves or tea bags to the spiced water. If you're using loose tea leaves, you can use a tea strainer or a muslin cloth to contain them.</li>
        <li> Let the tea steep in the spiced water for about 3-5 minutes or until it reaches your desired strength. The longer you steep, the stronger the tea flavor.</li>
        <li> Add the milk to the tea. You can adjust the amount of milk according to your preference, whether you like a stronger tea taste or a creamier texture.</li>
