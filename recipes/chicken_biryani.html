    </p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>

        <li>1 cup yogurt (curd) </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger-garlic paste</li>

        <li> 1 teaspoon biryani masala </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
        <li> Salt to taste</li>
    
        <p>
            For cooking rice:
        </p>
        <li> 2 cups Basmati rice</li>
        <li> 4-5 cups water </li>
        <li> Whole spices (2-3 bay leaves, 4-5 green cardamoms, 4-5 cloves, 1-inch cinnamon stick) </li>
        <p> For biryani masala:</p>

        <li> 2 large onions, thinly sliced </li>
        <li> 1/4 cup oil or ghee</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, slit </li>
        <li> 1/2 cup chopped mint leaves</li>
        <li> 1/2 cup chopped coriander leaves</li>

        <p> For layering and garnish:</p>
        <li> Saffron strands soaked in warm milk </li>
        <li> Fried onions (from the biryani masala) </li>
        <li> Ghee </li>
        <li> Few drops of rose water (optional)</li>

    </ul>
    <h4> Instructions:</h4>
    <ol> 
        <li> Marinate the chicken: 
            In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients listed under "marinating the chicken." 
            Make sure the chicken is well coated with the marinade.
            Cover the bowl and let it marinate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight, in the refrigerator.</li>

        <li> Cook the rice: Wash the Basmati rice under running water until the water runs clear. In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil. Add the whole spices and the washed rice. Cook the rice until it is 70-80% cooked (the grains should still have a slight bite to them). Drain the rice and set it aside. </li>
        <li> Prepare the biryani masala: In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat oil or ghee over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown and crispy. Remove about half of the fried onions and set them aside for layering and garnishing. To the remaining onions in the pan, add the slit green chilies, chopped mint leaves, and chopped coriander leaves. Cook for a couple of minutes until the flavors blend. </li>
        <li> Layering the biryani: In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a biryani handi, start layering the biryani. Add a layer of marinated chicken at the bottom, followed by a layer of partially cooked rice. Sprinkle some of the reserved fried onions, saffron milk, and a few drops of rose water (if using) on top. Repeat the layers until all the chicken and rice are used up. The topmost layer should be rice. </li>
        <li> Dum cooking: Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to trap the steam. Cook the biryani on very low heat (sim) for about 25-30 minutes. This slow cooking process is known as "dum cooking" and allows the flavors to meld and the rice and chicken to cook together. </li>
        <li>Once the biryani is cooked, turn off the heat and let it rest for a few minutes before gently fluffing it with a fork. </li>
        <li>Serve the Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani hot, garnished with some fresh mint and coriander leaves. Enjoy the delicious flavors and aromas of this classic dish! </li>
